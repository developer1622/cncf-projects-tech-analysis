# cncf-projects-tech-analysis
This repo tries to analyze(publicly available data only; of course, it is OSS) the CNCF project's tech and tools. Also, it attempts incremental steps to do state-of-the-art data visualization(not available as part of the CNCF Grafana board) using available and derived data.
